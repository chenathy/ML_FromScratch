1. Initialization:  

- The first step is to choose the number of clusters (K) and randomly initialize K centroids within the range of the dataset.
- The centroids can be initialized using various methods such as random selection or K-means++ algorithm.  

---
2. Assigning data points to clusters:  

- In this step, each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid based on its distance.
- The distance can be calculated using various distance metrics such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or cosine distance.  

---
3. Updating the centroids:  

- Once the data points are assigned to the clusters, the centroids are updated by calculating the mean of all the data points in each cluster.
- The new centroids become the center of their respective clusters.  

---
4. Repeating Steps 2 and 3:  

- Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the centroids no longer move significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
- At each iteration, the data points are reassigned to the nearest centroids, and the centroids are updated again.

---
5. Determining the optimal number of clusters:  
- The number of clusters (K) can greatly affect the results of the K-means algorithm.
- Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal value of K before running the algorithm.
- The elbow method or silhouette analysis can be used to determine the optimal value of K.

---
6. Output:

- The output of the K-means algorithm is the final centroids and the assignment of each data point to a cluster.
- The results can be visualized using various plots such as scatter plots or heatmaps.



Here is a more detailed explanation of each step:

1. Initialize the algorithm by specifying the number of clusters (k) and randomly selecting k data points as the initial centroids.
K-Means starts by randomly selecting k data points from the dataset to be the initial centroids. 
These initial centroids can be selected randomly or with a more sophisticated method like k-means++.

2. Assign each data point to the closest centroid based on the Euclidean distance between the data point and the centroids.
Each data point is assigned to the closest centroid based on the Euclidean distance between the data point and the centroids. 
The distance between a data point x and a centroid c is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: 
dist(x, c) = sqrt((x1-c1)^2 + (x2-c2)^2 + ... + (xn-cn)^2), where n is the number of dimensions/features in the dataset.

3. Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all the data points assigned to each cluster.
After all data points have been assigned to a centroid, the position of each centroid is updated by calculating the mean of all the data points assigned to that centroid. 
This is done separately for each cluster/centroid.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence, which is usually determined by a maximum number of iterations or a minimum change in the centroid positions.
Steps 2 and 3 are repeated iteratively until convergence. 
Convergence is typically determined by a maximum number of iterations or a minimum change in the centroid positions between iterations. If the centroids don't move much between iterations, the algorithm has converged.

5. Output the final centroids and the cluster assignments of each data point.
Once the algorithm has converged, the final positions of the centroids are output along with the cluster assignments of each data point. Each data point is assigned to the centroid of the cluster it belongs to.
