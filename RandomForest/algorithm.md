<h3>1. Data Preparation: </h3>
The first step is to prepare the data for the Random Forest algorithm. This includes data cleaning, data normalization, and feature selection.
<br>
<h3>2. Random Sampling: </h3>
The next step is to randomly sample the data from the dataset. <br>
Random sampling is done to create multiple training datasets that are used to train the decision trees.
<br>
<h3>3. Decision Tree Construction: </h3> 
A decision tree is constructed for each training dataset. <br>
The decision tree is constructed by splitting the data into subsets based on the values of the input features. <br>
The split is chosen to maximize the information gain or minimize the impurity of the subsets.
<br>
<h3>4. Tree Ensemble: </h4>
The decision trees constructed in the previous step are combined to form a tree ensemble. <br>
The tree ensemble is used to predict the output for a new input.
<br>
<br>
The idea behind the tree ensemble is to combine the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve the overall accuracy and reduce the variance of the model.<br>
When building a Random Forest, we create multiple decision trees, where each tree is trained on a different subset of the training data. To make a prediction, we pass the input data through each of the decision trees, and then combine the individual predictions to form the final prediction.

<br>
There are two popular methods for combining the predictions of the decision trees in the tree ensemble: <b>bagging</b> and <b>boosting</b>.
<br>
<h4>bagging:</h4> 
Bagging (short for Bootstrap Aggregating) is a method where each decision tree in the ensemble is trained on a different subset of the training data, sampled with replacement from the original dataset. <br>
This means that each tree in the ensemble is trained on a slightly different dataset, which helps to reduce the variance of the model. <br>
The final prediction is made by taking the average of the predictions of all the trees in the ensemble.

<h4>boosting:</h4>
Boosting is a method where each decision tree in the ensemble is trained on a different subset of the training data, but unlike bagging, the sampling is done without replacement. <br>
In boosting, each tree is trained to correct the errors of the previous tree in the ensemble. <br>
The final prediction is made by adding the predictions of all the trees in the ensemble, with the contribution of each tree weighted based on its performance.


<h3>5. Prediction: </h5>
To make a prediction using the Random Forest algorithm, the new input is passed through all the decision trees in the ensemble. <br>
The prediction is made by taking the average of the output values predicted by all the decision trees.
<br>
<h3>6. Model Evaluation: </h3>
Finally, the performance of the Random Forest algorithm is evaluated using different metrics <br>
such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and so on.
