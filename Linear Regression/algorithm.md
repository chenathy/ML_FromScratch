###training a linear regression model 
with gradient descent optimization, where the model parameters include 
- the bias term (b)
- weight vector (w)
- a learning rate (alpha)   

is used:

**Step 1**  
Initialize the bias term and weight vector with random values.  

**Step 2**  
Calculate the predicted values of the output variable using the current model parameters (i.e., the bias term and weight vector) for all training examples.  

**Step 3**  
Calculate the error between the predicted values and the true output variable values for all training examples.  

**Step 4**
Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the bias term and weight vector using the error values and the input features.  

**Step 5**  
Update the bias term and weight vector by subtracting the gradient multiplied by the learning rate alpha.  

**Step 6**  
Repeat steps 2-5 for a fixed number of iterations or until the model converges (i.e., the cost function no longer decreases significantly).  

**Step 7**  
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data by calculating the dot product between the input feature vector and the weight vector, adding the bias term, and returning the result.
