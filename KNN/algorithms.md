1. Load the dataset: Load the training dataset into memory. This dataset should contain labeled examples of inputs and outputs.

2. Choose the value of k: Choose a value for k, which represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction. This value should be an odd number to avoid ties in binary classification problems.

3. Choose a distance metric: Choose a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance, to measure the distance between the input data and the training data.

4. Preprocess the data: Preprocess the input data to ensure that it is in the same format as the training data.

5. Calculate distances: Calculate the distance between the input data and each training data point using the chosen distance metric.

6. Choose the k-nearest neighbors: Select the k training data points that are closest to the input data based on the distance metric.

7. Make a prediction: For classification problems, count the number of examples in each class among the k-nearest neighbors, and predict the class with the highest count. For regression problems, take the average of the output values among the k-nearest neighbors and use this as the predicted output value.

8. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model using a separate validation dataset or through cross-validation.

9. Tune the model: Adjust the hyperparameters of the KNN algorithm, such as the value of k or the choice of distance metric, to improve its performance on the validation dataset.

10. Make predictions: Once the model has been trained and tuned, it can be used to make predictions on new input data.
